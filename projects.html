            <h3>Terminal Can't Hurt You (Django)</h3>
            <p>Fall 2025 CSCI 258. Terminal Can't Hurt You (TCHUY) was a group final project for CSCI285. The idea was a online learning platform to help people learn simple terminal commands and languages like BASH or Powershell. It was designed with classroom enviroments in mind so its focused around have multiple types of accounts like students, teachers, or just personal.</p>

            <h3>Family Bingo App (Django)</h3>
            <p>A Web App develped originaly as a family joke. This app allows for custom bingo cards to be created and played against other family memebers. Members can create accounts and set up their own bingo cards, Admin account can control things such as board size or reset players cards. While it lacks Style, I do wish to come back to it someday to add that.</p>
